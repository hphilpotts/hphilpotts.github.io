        <p>This is a full-stack web app - Album Review App: a site where users can add and then review music albums - built as part of a paired project with <a href="https://github.com/milosjocic1">Milos Jocic</a> over the course of a week, for the second project in GA London's Software Engineering Immersive course. The app uses an Express framework, Node.js platform and an Atlas-hosted MongoDB NoSQL database. The deployed project was presented to my GA Instructional Team and fellow SEI cohort on 26/08/22.      </p>
        <p>I was 'Team Leader' for this project, taking responsibility for Git version control and deployment of the completed app. I worked on broader functionality across the site both in Frontend and Backend: setting up `server.js` config, creating Models, writing routes and APIs, implementing Views, forms and user input. I also took ownership of UI styling and mobile responsive formatting.</p>

        <p>This was a really exciting project for me, as it was the first time I had properly collaborated with another developer on a piece of work. We had been given relatively little in the way of guidance or instructions when it came to working as a pair; as a result, we had to very much learn how best to code together 'on the fly' which was both challenging and rewarding. I am really grateful for the fact that Milos and I had a great working dynamic: our skills and approaches complemented each other and we had fun working on this project together - for me this was a great start to collaborative coding!</p>
        <p>Much of the project was completed using very close collaboration, particularly using screen sharing. The benefits of working together became apparent very quickly: two pairs of eyes catch bugs more quickly, and one person may remember a small but crucial tidbit of information from a past lecture where the other does not. Equally, the challenges of working as a pair rather than solo also became apparent very quickly: Git & GitHub become significantly more complicated to use compared to lone working, code conflicts are many and frequently encountered, and time management becomes more important.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, this project was really enjoyable, and the feeling of collaboratively producing something you are proud of made me feel excited for my future working in software development. I learned a lot both technically and in terms of how best to work as a team, and came away from the project more confident in my skills and knowledge.</p>
