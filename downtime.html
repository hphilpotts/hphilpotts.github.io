        <br><hr><br>

        <p>If I'm not working or sharpening my coding skills, I'll probably be either cycling or eating (and on occasion, both).
            <br><br>I got into cycling during the early days of 'lockdown' when my fear of London roads was surpassed by my fear of the then-novel Coronavirus. I started out commuting on Santander Cycles (in a shirt and tie, no less), but vowed never to become 'one of those' cyclists. Next thing I knew, I was cycling in my free time as well as to work. Then a few months later came my first new bike in about 20 years. Then the lycra started to appear. Then I started watching cycling on TV. And finally, with my first road bike - a rather vicarly Condor Fratello - the transformation was complete...
            <div class="img-container">
              <img src="./img/bike.png" alt="powder blue Condor Fratello road bike against rural estate fencing" class="text-image">
            </div>
            <br>I've accepted the fact that - thanks in particular to my equal passion for unhealthy foods - I'm unlikely to make it to the Tour, so instead I try to focus on going far rather than fast, preferably with a decent cafe (or pub!) stop halfway. My goal in 2023 is to do at least one 100km 'metric century' ride each month: less fun in the winter months but always an adventure!
            <br><br>Where cycling has been a relatively new interest, food (primarily, the eating of) has been an ever-present love-affair for as long as I can remember. I'd call myself a capable cook, but if I'm honest all I have learned has been in order to increase my chances of eating delicious food, rather than for any other reason or motiation. My move to London about 8 years ago opened up so many doors in terms of incredible, varied things to discover and devour - and then attempt to replicate at home.
            <div class="img-container">
              <img src="./img/burger.png" alt="" class="text-image smaller">
            </div>
            <br>I'm on the quest for the perfect burger: Patty & Bun's 'Ari Gold' cheesburger is my favourite of London's offerings, but I believe this iconic burger was surpassed by a homemade 'All-Borough Market' attempt last year. Northfield Farm chuck/brisket mince and streaky bacon, Raclette and cornichons from 'Jumi', 'Bread Ahead' buns...all very extravagant (and expensive) but worth it. Second only to burgers comes pizza - I did a 'pizza crawl' for my last birthday - and otherwise I'm happiest cooking and eating stews, ragus and pasta sauces.
            <br><br>
            Outside of food and cycling, I'm a reluctant runner (purely for medicinal purposes), a budding wine enthusiast and a musical omnivore (any coding background music recommendations gladly accepted). I took up the ukulele during my GA course - presumably much to the dismay of my neighbours, sorry! - in order to give the other side of my brain a run out. I find strumming away on the uke' helps encourage those 'eureka' moments when I'm stuck on some code. If I can get somewhere by walking I will, I love exploring London and finding great new pubs, and I'd love to start travelling more than I currently do!
