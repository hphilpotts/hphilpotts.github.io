        <p>This is a MERN stack web application - Pokégotchi - built as group of three <a href="https://github.com/EHCarr">Ashish</a> (Team Leader), <a href="https://github.com/Emsley1d">Dan</a> and I) in a timescale of one week, using linked frontend and backend applications: a Node.js backend, with Express framework and an Atlas hosted MongoDB database, linked to a React-based frontend application.</p>
        <p>This was Project 4 - the 'capstone' project - completed as part of General Assembly London's Software Engineering Immersive course. We presented a deployed version to my Instructional Team and fellow SEI cohort on 26/08/22.</p>

        <p>This web app is a crossover between Tamagotchi and Pokémon, where users can select a Pokémon and then look after them: for example by healing them if injured in battle, or feeding them if they are hungry after not being fed for a while. The frontend app makes use of React's Single Page Application capability, meaning that the UI can render and update without the need for navigating between pages.</p>
        <p>I focused primarily on the frontend of the application, creating and styling all components with the exception of Pokedex.js and Choice.js. This includes signup/sign in, frontend authentication, User CRUD operations, the Pokégotchi card and overall main App UI/UX. I also worked on the backend User APIs as well as some further backend APIs and functionality.     </p>

        <p>My number one takeaway from this: React is tough. Number two though: React is powerful, sleek and fast; it is great fun to work with and rewarding when you get things working. I'm very glad we covered React as the last part of the course: I think if we had looked at it sooner I would have been put off, rather than emerging the other side feeling excited about the prospect of working with it again. I came out of this project a much better - and indeed much more confident - React developer than when I went in and I am so thankful that I opted to work primarily on the frontend, as it really changed my perception of working with React. To have worked only on the backend would have meant missing out on this!</p>
        <p>I enjoyed this project tremendously from start to finish (yes - even when things were not working or just plain going wrong!). It represented the moment where I turned a corner not just in terms of React, but also in so many other aspects. CSS finally 'clicked' for me, communication between frontend and backend suddenly became so much clearer, APIs stopped being quite so mysterious. I loved going back to the Express framework again (it felt like an 'old friend' after 21 full-on days of Python & Django). Most importantly, I finally learned to value error messages: they're nothing to get annoyed or down about, they're literally just there to tell you what went wrong - in short, they're there to help you!</p>
        <p>Our finished product is still rough around the edges and not yet where I'd wanted or hoped for it to be, but the journey getting there is the important thing. I'm still proud to show off the app, but prouder still to show off the code that I had written. Lastly, I'm glad that I took the opportunity to work with two great developers rather than working solo as I had initially intended: this project really was a fantastic (albeit very intense!) way to finish off the course.</p>
