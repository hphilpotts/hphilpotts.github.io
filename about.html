      <h5>
        Here's a bit about my coding journey, my career background, and what I do when I'm not coding, working or sleeping:
      </h5><br>

      <h3>- My coding journey (so far)</h3>

      <p>My passion for coding was first sparked through completing small coding challenges sent to me by a friend who had recently made a career switch into coding. In myself I recognised a lot of qualities that had made them successful in the Software Design industry; thanks to some free time during periods of self-isolation in 2021 I began to dig a little further, soon finding that coding is something I really enjoyed and had the potential to be good at.
        <br><br>
        Seeing the possibility of being paid to do something enjoyable, fulfilling and rewarding led me to explore the possibility of making the switch into Software Engineering from my current role. Thanks to a flexible working opportunity with my current employer, I was able to enrol on a full-time Software Engineering Immersive with GA in order to fast-track the learning I had already started on my own and make the leap into a new career. 
        <br><br>
        I completed GA London's Software Engineering Immersive Course in October 2022 and from there have begun the search for my first coding job! In order to keep my coding skills sharp in the meantime, I have been working on Personal Projects and sharpening up my GA London Projects (links in header!) as well as lots of Codewars Kata <a>(CW profile here!).</a>

      <h3>- My career background before 'making the switch'</h3>
      <p>
        I have ten years’ Retail experience, managing small teams in demanding environments. I’ve always been quick to learn, to grasp new concepts, and able to retain information well, but after graduating Universtity I found that I lacked some of the soft skills needed to succeed in many workplaces. I wanted to find a job that would push me in these areas where I was less comfortable, and this led me to Waitrose.
        <br><br>
        In the ten years since, I have progressed from part-time ‘Christmas temp’, to full-time Partner, Team Leader, Duty Manager and then Team Manager. This progress represents the learning, building and then sharpening of these people skills that I once lacked. I now find myself in a place where the things that once challenged me at the beginning of my career are completely natural. My next chapter requires looking for new challenges elsewhere that will instead stretch my mental and technical abilities.
        <br><br>
        I am driven by results and recognition and have a competitive nature that pushes me to work harder in order to be the best I can be. A culture of sharing in and celebrating successes is something I always try to foster in the team around me. For this reason, I am looking to work in an innovative, driven and supportive team that delivers collectively whilst pushing individuals to fulfil their potential.
        <br><br> 
        My belief is that the skills I have built in my career to date, coupled with the technical knowledge gained from the GA course set me apart from other candidates. I know I will thrive in any workplace environment thanks to the emotional literacy and professional approach I have developed as well as my friendly, open nature.
        <br><br>
        My short term aim is a Junior Software Developer role in a team and company that values and encourages personal and technical development, potentially in a large and established brand with a strongly defined culture and vision. From this, I hope to build my skills to the point where I can take on Mid-Weight and then Senior roles, with an ultimate aim of stepping into the Technical Evangelist route.
      </p>
