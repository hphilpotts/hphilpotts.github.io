        my coding journey  |  career to date  |  downtime
      </h5><hr><br>

      <h4>My coding journey (so far)</h4>

      <p>My passion for coding was first sparked by a friend with a similar career background who had recently made a career switch into software development. We got talking about coding and the software design industry and I recognised a lot of qualities that had made them successful in their new career in myself. Thanks to some free time during a two week period of self-isolation in 2021 I began to dig a little further, then moving on to completing various 'Codecademy' courses on my days off, before being introduced to coding 'puzzles' such as Codewars. I soon found that coding was something I really enjoyed and had the potential to be good at.
        <br><br>
        Seeing the possibility of being paid to do something enjoyable, fulfilling and genuinely rewarding led me to explore the possibility of making the switch into Software Engineering from my current role in Retail Management. Thanks to a flexible working opportunity with my current employer, I was able to enrol on a full-time Software Engineering Immersive with GA in order to fast-track the learning I had already started on my own and make the leap into a new career. 
        <br><br>
        I completed GA London's Software Engineering Immersive Course in October 2022 and from there have begun the search for my first coding job. In order to keep my coding skills sharp in the meantime, I have been working on Personal Projects and sharpening up my GA London Projects (links in header!) as well as lots of Codewars Kata <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/hphilpotts">(CW profile here!).</a>

      <h4>My career background before 'making the switch'</h4>
      <p>
        I have ten years' Retail experience, managing small teams in demanding environments. I've always been quick to learn, to grasp new concepts, and able to retain information well, but after graduating Universtity I found that I lacked some of the soft skills needed to succeed in many workplaces. I wanted to find a job that would push me in these areas where I was less comfortable, and this led me to Waitrose.
        <br><br>
        In the ten years since, I have progressed from part-time 'Christmas temp', to full-time Partner, Team Leader, Duty Manager and then Team Manager. This progress represents the learning, building and then sharpening of these people skills that I once lacked. I now find myself in a place where the things that once challenged me at the beginning of my career are completely natural. My next chapter requires looking for new challenges elsewhere that will instead stretch my mental and technical abilities.
        <br><br>
        I am driven by results and recognition and have a competitive nature that pushes me to work harder in order to be the best I can be. A culture of sharing in and celebrating successes is something I always try to foster in the team around me. For this reason, I am looking to work in an innovative, driven and supportive team that delivers collectively whilst pushing individuals to fulfil their potential.
        <br><br> 
        My belief is that the skills I have built in my career to date, coupled with the technical knowledge gained from the GA course set me apart from other candidates. I know I will thrive in any workplace environment thanks to the emotional literacy and professional approach I have developed as well as my friendly, open nature.
        <br><br>
        My short term aim is a Junior Software Developer role in a team and company that values and encourages personal and technical development, potentially in an established brand with a strongly defined culture and vision. From this, I hope to build my skills to the point where I can take on Mid-Weight and then Senior roles, with an ultimate aim of stepping into the Technical Evangelist route.

      <h4>Outside of work and code</h4>
      <p>If I'm not working or sharpening my coding skills, I'll probably be either cycling or eating (and on occasion, both).
        <br><br>I got into cycling during the early days of 'lockdown' when my fear of London roads was surpassed by my fear of the then-novel Coronavirus. I started out commuting on Santander Cycles (in a shirt and tie, no less), but vowed never to become 'one of those' cyclists. Next thing I knew, I was cycling in my free time as well as to work. Then a few months later came my first new bike in about 20 years. Then the lycra started to appear. Then I started watching cycling on TV. And finally, with my first road bike - a rather vicarly Condor Fratello - the transformation was complete...
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="./img/bike.png" alt="powder blue Condor Fratello road bike against rural estate fencing" class="text-image">
        </div>
        <br>I've accepted the fact that - thanks in particular to my equal passion for unhealthy foods - I'm unlikely to make it to the Tour, so instead I try to focus on going far rather than fast, preferably with a decent cafe (or pub!) stop halfway. My goal in 2023 is to do at least one 100km 'metric century' ride each month: less fun in the winter months but always an adventure!
        <br><br>Where cycling has been a relatively new interest, food (primarily, the eating of) has been an ever-present love-affair for as long as I can remember. I'd call myself a capable cook, but if I'm honest all I have learned has been in order to increase my chances of eating delicious food, rather than for any other reason or motiation. My move to London about 8 years ago opened up so many doors in terms of incredible, varied things to discover and devour - and then attempt to replicate at home.
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="./img/burger.png" alt="" class="text-image smaller">
        </div>
        <br>I'm on the quest for the perfect burger: Patty & Bun's 'Ari Gold' cheesburger is my favourite of London's offerings, but I believe this iconic burger was surpassed by a homemade 'All-Borough Market' attempt last year. Northfield Farm chuck/brisket mince and streaky bacon, Raclette and cornichons from 'Jumi', 'Bread Ahead' buns...all very extravagant (and expensive) but worth it. Second only to burgers comes pizza - I did a 'pizza crawl' for my last birthday - and otherwise I'm happiest cooking and eating stews, ragus and pasta sauces.
        <br><br>
        Outside of food and cycling, I'm a reluctant runner (purely for medicinal purposes), a budding wine enthusiast and a musical omnivore (any coding background music recommendations gladly accepted). I took up the ukulele during my GA course - presumably much to the dismay of my neighbours, sorry! - in order to give the other side of my brain a run out. I find strumming away on the uke' helps encourage those 'eureka' moments when I'm stuck on some code. If I can get somewhere by walking I will, I love exploring London and finding great new pubs, and I'd love to start travelling more than I currently do!
