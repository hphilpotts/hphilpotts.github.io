        <p>This is an image-based, Pinterest-type 'mood board' web app, built as a team of three (<a href="https://github.com/HelenevB">Helene</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ic188002">Ivan</a> and I) in one week using Python within a Django framework, linked to PostgreSQL SQL database. Users can sign up, upload images, create mood boards and then link both their own or other users' images to their 'boards' This project was completed as the third project for General Assembly London's Software Engineering Immersive course, and was presented to my Instructional Team and fellow SEI cohort on 07/10/22.</p>
        <p>My particular focus for this project was primarily on User functionality: signup, authentication and authorisation, profile CRUD operations and password reset. I also worked on formatting and Materialize 'Toast' notifications for User feedback. This project was my first experience of working as a 'team member' (rather than team leader) within a group, and my first experience of working in a group of 3 or more developers.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed this project as it was an opportunity to create a web app using a 'new' language after 6 weeks of JavaScript. I had spent some time self-teaching Python before starting the course - so had a bit of familiarity with its syntax - but crucially I found that the concepts and skills learned on JS translated across really quickly into Python having come back to it after a few months. Picking things up comparatively quickly was a great feeling!</p>
        <p>It was a great experience working as a team of three for the first time, especially as we all had such different strengths and weaknesses (and indeed personalities and approaches!). Our 'team culture' was supportive and many of the challenges faced in Project 2 were much easier to overcome the second time around.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I had fun working with Django, especially using the 'baked in' functionality as compared to Express' more minimalist framework. I found it to be quick to pick up and I was a fan of the built-in admin app and auth features. Looking back, Python/Django seems somewhat 'alien' to me now, but I know that this project was great for my confidence, and has been a great foundation, putting me in a great place for when I revisit Python and Django in the future.</p>
