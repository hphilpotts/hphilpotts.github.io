                    under construction and is my current side-project. Going back to React after a
                    number of months has been challenging but rewarding - I'm excited to demonstrate what I

                    This web app is a crossover between Tamagotchi and Pokémon, where users
                    can
                    select a Pokémon and then look after them: for example by healing them
                    if
                    injured in battle, or feeding them if they are hungry after not being
                    fed for a
                    while. The frontend app makes use of React's Single Page Application
                    capability,
                    meaning that the UI can render and update without the need for
                    navigating
                    between pages.

                    I focused primarily on the frontend of the application, creating and
                    styling all
                    components with the exception of Pokedex.js and Choice.js. This includes
                    signup/sign in, frontend authentication, User CRUD operations, the
                    Pokégotchi
                    card and overall main App UI/UX. I also worked on the backend User APIs
                    as well
                    as some further backend APIs and functionality.

                      href="https://github.com/ic188002">Ivan</a> and me) in one week using Python
                    within a Django framework, linked to PostgreSQL SQL database.</p>
                  <p>Users can sign up, upload images, create mood boards and then link both their own
                    or other users' images to their 'boards'.</p>
                  <p>This project was completed as the third project for General Assembly London's
                    Software Engineering Immersive course, and was presented to my Instructional
                    Team and fellow SEI cohort on 07/10/22.</p>

                  <p> I enjoyed this project as it was an opportunity to create a web app using a
                    'new'
                    language after 6 weeks of JavaScript.</p>
                  <p> I had spent some time self-teaching Python
                    before starting the course - so had a bit of familiarity with its syntax - but
                    crucially I found that the concepts and skills learned on JS translated across
                    really quickly into Python having come back to it after a few months. Picking
                    things up comparatively quickly was a great feeling!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="slide-body-content-item" id="item-4-3">
                  <p>I had fun working with Django, especially using the 'baked in' functionality as
                    compared to Express' more minimalist framework. I found it to be quick to pick
                    up and I was a fan of the built-in admin app and auth features.</p>
                  <p> Looking back, Python/Django seems somewhat 'alien' to me now, but I know that
                    this project was great for my confidence, and has been a great foundation,
                    putting me in a great place for when I revisit Python and Django in the future.

                  <p>I worked on broader functionality across the site both in Frontend and Backend:

                    given relatively little in the way of guidance or instructions when it came
                    to working as a pair; as a result, we had to very much learn how best to
                    code together 'on the fly' which was both challenging and rewarding.</p>
                  <p>I am really grateful for the fact that Milos and I had a great working dynamic:
                    our skills and approaches complemented each other and we had fun working on

                    really proud of: these experiences were confirmation that this was something I

                  <p>I had struggled with CSS positioning in the two weeks before the project (and -
                    if I'm honest - during the project too!), however getting positive feedback on
                    how my app was shaping up was another great confidence booster. Lastly, it gave
                    me a great introduction to project work as a whole, particularly Wireframing,
                    project planning and management, and Git version control.</p>

            My passion for coding was first sparked by a friend with a similar career background who had
            recently made a career switch into software development. We got talking about coding and the
            software design industry and I recognised a lot of qualities that had made them successful in
            their new career in myself. Thanks to some free time during a two week period of self-isolation
            in 2021 I began to dig a little further, then moving on to completing various 'Codecademy'
            courses on my days off, before being introduced to coding 'puzzles' such as Codewars. I soon
            found that coding was something I really enjoyed and had the potential to be good at.
            <br><br>
            Seeing the possibility of being paid to do something enjoyable, fulfilling and genuinely
            rewarding led me to explore the possibility of making the switch into Software Engineering from
            my current role in Retail Management. Thanks to a flexible working opportunity with my current
            employer, I was able to enrol on a full-time Software Engineering Immersive with GA in order to
            fast-track the learning I had already started on my own and make the leap into a new career.
            <br><br>
            I completed GA London's Software Engineering Immersive Course in October 2022 and from there
            have begun the search for my first coding job. In order to keep my coding skills sharp in the
            meantime, I have been working on Personal Projects and sharpening up my GA London Projects
            (links in header!) as well as lots of Codewars Kata <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/hphilpotts">(CW
              profile here!).</a>

            JavaScript is my favourite language to work in, although I really enjoy learning and working
            with Python, and spent time learning Ruby prior to completing the GA course. In particular, I
            find it fascinating how different approaches can be used to solve a problem, depending on the
            language being used. I'm equally happy working on the front-end as much as the back-end - even
            better if I get to do both!

            I have ten years' Retail experience, managing small teams in demanding environments. I've always
            been quick to learn, to grasp new concepts, and able to retain information well, but after
            graduating from Universtity I found that I lacked some of the soft skills needed to succeed in
            many workplaces. I wanted to find a job that would push me in these areas where I was less
            comfortable, and this led me to Waitrose.
            <br><br>
            In the ten years since, I have progressed from part-time 'Christmas temp', to full-time Partner,
            Team Leader, Duty Manager and then Team Manager. This progress represents the learning, building
            and then sharpening of these people skills that I once lacked. I now find myself in a place
            where the things that once challenged me at the beginning of my career are completely natural.
            My next chapter requires looking for new challenges elsewhere that will instead stretch my
            mental and technical abilities.
            <br><br>
            I am driven by results and recognition and have a competitive nature that pushes me to work
            harder in order to be the best I can be. A culture of sharing in and celebrating successes is
            something I always try to foster in the team around me. For this reason, I am looking to work in
            an innovative, driven and supportive team that delivers collectively whilst pushing individuals
            to fulfil their potential.
            <br><br>
            My belief is that the skills I have built in my career to date, coupled with the technical
            knowledge gained from the GA course set me apart from other candidates. I know I will thrive in
            any workplace environment thanks to the emotional literacy and professional approach I have
            developed as well as my friendly, open nature.
            <br><br>
            My short term aim is a Junior Software Developer role in a team and company that values and
            encourages personal and technical development, potentially in an established brand with a
            strongly defined culture and vision. From this, I hope to build my skills to the point where I
            can take on Mid-Weight and then Senior roles.

          <p>If I'm not working or sharpening my coding skills, I'll probably be either cycling or eating (and
            on occasion, both).
            <br><br>I got into cycling during the early days of 'lockdown' when my fear of London roads was
            surpassed by my fear of the then-novel Coronavirus. I started out commuting on Santander Cycles
            (in a shirt and tie, no less), but vowed never to become 'one of those' cyclists. Next thing I
            knew, I was cycling in my free time as well as to work. Then a few months later came my first
            new bike in about 20 years. Then the lycra started to appear. Then I started watching cycling on
            TV. And finally, with my first road bike - a rather vicarly Condor Fratello - the transformation
            was complete...
          <div>
            <img src="./img/bike.png" alt="powder blue Condor Fratello road bike against rural estate fencing"

          <br>I've accepted the fact that - thanks in particular to my equal passion for unhealthy foods - I'm
          unlikely to make it to the Tour, so instead I try to focus on going far rather than fast, preferably
          with a decent cafe (or pub!) stop halfway. My goal in 2023 is to do at least one 100km 'metric
          century' ride each month: less fun in the winter months but always an adventure!
          <br><br>Where cycling has been a relatively new interest, food (primarily, the eating of) has been
          an ever-present love-affair for as long as I can remember. I'd call myself a capable cook, but if
          I'm honest all I have learned has been in order to increase my chances of eating delicious food,
          rather than for any other reason or motiation. My move to London about 8 years ago opened up so many
          doors in terms of incredible, varied things to discover and devour - and then attempt to replicate
          at home.

          <br>I'm on the quest for the perfect burger: Patty & Bun's 'Ari Gold' cheesburger is my favourite of
          London's offerings, but I believe this iconic burger was surpassed by a homemade 'All-Borough
          Market' attempt last year. Northfield Farm chuck/brisket mince and streaky bacon, Raclette and
          cornichons from 'Jumi', 'Bread Ahead' buns...all very extravagant (and expensive) but worth it.
          Second only to burgers comes pizza - I did a 'pizza crawl' for my last birthday - and otherwise I'm
          happiest cooking and eating stews, ragus and pasta sauces.

          Outside of food and cycling, I'm a reluctant runner (purely for medicinal purposes), a budding wine
          enthusiast and a musical omnivore (any coding background music recommendations gladly accepted). I
          took up the ukulele during my GA course - presumably much to the dismay of my neighbours, sorry! -
          in order to give the other side of my brain a run out. I find strumming away on the uke' helps
          encourage those 'eureka' moments when I'm stuck on some code. If I can get somewhere by walking I
          will, I love exploring London and finding great new pubs, and I'd love to start travelling more than
          I currently do!
